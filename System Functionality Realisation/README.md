# COMS3002_Proj_G3

This section/sprint of the project involves determining the functionality of the system. It will include all documentation created and used in the process of realizing the system's functionality. In order to do this, the process was divided into smaller section in order to make it easier to identify all the functionality required in the system. This includes:

## User Story creation
This section invloves placing ourselves in shoes of the various users and creating a list of stories that outline what the the user wants to be able to do on the system.

## Use Case List and Catagorization
This section involves going through the list of user stories created in the previous section and extrapolating from them a list of use cases. Following this, once the use cases list has been created, each use case was categories into one of three categories. This is done in order to create a priority ranking of the use cases where the "vital" functionality will be given a the highest priority and the "fluff" the least.

### Vital
These are use cases that define the functionalities that are vital to the system. They the key functionality of the system and hence the most important. For example, creating and updating a user account.

### Complementary
These are use cases that define the functionalities that support and enhance the system and make it more robust. For example, live chat system for home seekers and brokers.

### Fluff
These are use cases that define the functionaleis that are not so important but enhance the system and improving the user experience. For example, a house search history for home seekers

## Use Case Description
This section will involve a partially dressed use case description of the vital use cases as listed in the previous section. This description will include use case ID, name, scope, trigger event, description, actors, related use cases, pre-conditions and post-conditions. This section focuses on vital us as a result of the limited time given to this project.
