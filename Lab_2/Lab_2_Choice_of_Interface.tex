\section{Front-end User Interface Choice}

	Front-end User Interface Methods:
	\newline
	1.) Website: Browser
	\newline
	2.) Mobile App:  Android and other platforms
	\newline
	3.) Desktop App


\section{Choice of User-Interface:}
	I think the best UI to use for our project is a website, because it will be accessible on any device that has a browser and an internet connection. It will compatible with most devices i.e.) It will not be restricted to only a computer or a phone.
	\newline\newline
	Websites are accessible to a widest possible audience, as compared to applications that will still have to be downloaded. The maintainer can instantly add some updates to the website and users don't have to download the latest version of the website to be able to use it. 
	\newline\newline
	Websites can easily be shared between users by a simple link over social media, whereas with applications it is not that easy to do so.
	\newline\newline
	Maintenance and support of websites are not that expensive whereas with applications you must do upgrades, testing and take care of compatibility issues, which is much more expensive.
	\newline\newline
	Websites are much easier for users to find because their pages can be displayed in search results.
